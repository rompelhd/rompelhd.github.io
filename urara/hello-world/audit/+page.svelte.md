# Introduction: Identifying Security Gaps in Controlled Environments

In today's digital landscape, securing network devices isn't just about firewalls and passwordsâ€”it's about continuously identifying and addressing hidden vulnerabilities. In this report, we performed a detailed scan and analysis of a local network device to demonstrate common misconfigurations that could pose serious risks if left unchecked.

> **Disclaimer:** All tests and procedures were conducted in a **controlled environment** with **explicit permission** to ensure ethical and legal compliance.

# Vulnerability Findings

### Detected Device Information:

- **Host Name:** `IMP64.Example.xx`
- **IP Address:** `192.168.21.XXX`
- **Manufacturer (MAC Address):** Kyocera Display (`00:C0:EE:12:34:56`)

### Open Ports Discovered:

| **Port** | **Protocol** | **Service**      | **Description**                                         |
|----------|--------------|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| **21**   | TCP          | **FTP**          | File Transfer Protocol service.                          |
| **80**   | TCP          | **HTTP**         | Active web server, potential administration interface.   |
| **139**  | TCP          | **NetBIOS-SSN**  | Windows file-sharing service.                           |
| **515**  | TCP          | **Printer**      | Printing service (Line Printer Daemon).                 |
| **9100-9103** | TCP     | **JetDirect**    | Network printing services.                              |

### Critical Configuration Flaw Identified:

During our examination of `IMP64.Example.xx`, we discovered a **serious security vulnerability**:

- **Default Admin Credentials:** The HTTP administration panel on port **80** was accessible without any security modifications. The device was using **default factory settings** for admin login, granting us full control over its configuration.

**Potential Risks:**

- Unauthorized access to sensitive print configurations.
- Possible interception and manipulation of print jobs.
- Risk of exposing confidential documents transmitted over the print network.

---

# Recommendations for Mitigation

1. **Change Default Admin Passwords:** Immediately update admin credentials with strong, unique passwords.

2. **Secure Web Access:**
   - Implement **HTTPS** instead of HTTP for encrypted communication.
   - Restrict access to the admin panel by configuring **IP whitelisting**.

3. **Disable Unused Services:**
   - Evaluate and disable unnecessary services like **FTP** and **NetBIOS**.

4. **Firmware Update:** Ensure the device is running the **latest firmware** version to protect against known vulnerabilities.

5. **Continuous Monitoring:** Enable logging and monitoring to detect any unauthorized access attempts.
