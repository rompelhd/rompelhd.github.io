# The April 28 Blackout: A Technological Perspective

On April 28, 2025, a massive power outage struck across Spain, Portugal, and parts of France, causing significant disruption to infrastructure, services, and digital systems. This widespread blackout had profound consequences, particularly in the realm of information technology.

## Impact on IT Systems

The sudden loss of electricity affected countless devices and networks. Servers, routers, personal computers, and data centers experienced abrupt shutdowns, leading to potential hardware damage and data corruption.

In my case, one of the nodes in my Proxmox cluster—used for managing virtual machines and containers—suffered severe corruption in its boot disk. Proxmox, being a robust virtualization environment based on Debian, is highly reliable, but even it cannot protect against the physical consequences of a total power loss.

## Risks to Powered-On Devices

Any systems left running during the blackout faced several risks:

- **Data Corruption**: Filesystems can become corrupted if data is being written at the moment of power loss.
- **Hardware Damage**: Sudden power cuts can harm hard drives and SSDs, especially older or heavily used ones.
- **Loss of Unsaved Work**: Systems without proper backup power lost unsaved data in volatile memory.
- **Boot Failures**: After the power was restored, some machines failed to reboot properly due to damaged system files.

## Recovery and Continuity

Despite the challenges, I was able to recover my systems with minimal data loss. Here’s how:

1. **Disk Repair**: I booted into a live Linux environment and used `fsck` and other tools to attempt recovery of the corrupted disk.
2. **Backup Restoration**: Thanks to regular backups, I was able to restore the most critical VMs from snapshots taken a day before the incident.
3. **Proxmox Reinstallation**: For the damaged node, I reinstalled Proxmox and rejoined it to the cluster.

Despite the setback, I continued my GitHub projects without significant delay. My development environments are now more resilient, and I’ve learned valuable lessons about infrastructure planning and disaster recovery.
